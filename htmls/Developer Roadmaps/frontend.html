              Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
              practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
              Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.

            Learn HTML
          </h3>
          <p class="description">
            HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the
            standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML describes
            the structure of a website semantically along with cues for
            presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming
            language.

          </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
            on other media.

            JavaScript is a high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted
            programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript
            language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the
            three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production.

            Working with Web Forms

          <p class="description">
            Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user
            and a web site or application. Forms allow users to enter data,
            which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage
            (see Sending form data later in the module), or used on the
            client-side to immediately update the interface in some way.

            development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for
            building scalable, interactive web applications. Many modern
            companies use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so
            many front-end development jobs now require framework experience

            Accessibility Guide

          <p class="description">
            Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as
            many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being
            about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites
            accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile
            devices, or those with slow network connections.

            multiple team members will collaborate on. Using version control
            software helps you keep track of changes â€” and keep every team
            member working off the latest version.
