              Android app development is the process by which new applications
              are created for the Android devices operating system. Applications
              are usually developed in <strong>Java</strong> and/or
              <strong>Kotlin</strong> programming language using the Android app
              software development kit (SDK), but other development environments
              are also available. Google announced in 2019 to make Kotlin the
              preferred way of developing android applications.

            Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose
            programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to
            interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard
            library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows
            its syntax to be more concise.

            Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as

            about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites
            accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile
            devices, or those with slow network connections.
